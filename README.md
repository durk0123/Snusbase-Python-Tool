# Snusbase Free (NO SUB)

This Python script simply uses a workaround for Snusbase. Instead of using the standard API, which often requires a subscription (LOL), this script taps into a lesser-known, beta API endpoint offered by Snusbase. You can use usernames or email formats from what I know.

## Features

- **Alternative API Access**: Bypasses the standard Snusbase API, using a free beta endpoint.
- **Interactive Console UI**: Easy-to-use console-based user interface.
- **Color-Coded Error Messages**: Enhanced readability with colored terminal outputs for errors.
- **File Saving Option**: Allows saving the query results in JSON format.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on different operating systems with terminal clear functionality.

## Usage

Run the script in your Python environment. You will be prompted to enter a search term. After the search, results (if any) will be displayed on the console. You also have the option to save these results to a file.

## Disclaimer

This tool is for educational and research purposes only.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `requests` library

## How to Run

```bash
python snusbase.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to enter a search term and handle the results.
